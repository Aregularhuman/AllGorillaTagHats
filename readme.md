# All Gorilla tag Modding Discord Hats
> Note that some hats might have their name changed or files edited to mitigate conflicts that might result in errors in-game.

You can either download the GitHub hats repo directly or [download the release zip](https://github.com/Waulta/AllGTMDiscordHats/releases/latest/). Although for the most up-to-date version of this pack you should click on [Download ZIP](https://github.com/Waulta/AllGTMDiscordHats/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), you can then open the hats folder and copy everything in there to your Gorilla tag hats folder.
